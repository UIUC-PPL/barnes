1) Get the utility repository from the ChaNGa collection. This is located at:

          git://charm.cs.illinois.edu/cosmo/utility


2) Edit the Makefile to set STRUCTURES_PATH to point to the structures
directory under the utility repository that you just cloned


3) Point the Makefile to your installation of charm by setting CHARM_PATH


4) Build the program and associated utilities (eg: make -j8)


5) Generate a dataset: ./plummer numparticles datafilename
   eg: ./plummer 1000 1k.dat


6) Run the program

   ./charmrun +p2 ++local ./barnes -in=1k.dat -ppc=100 -p=40
   -b=8 -dtime=0.0001 -killat=1000


-in  = dataset file name
-ppc = part per chare (tree piece)
-p   = maximum number of allowed of tree pieces

Overdecompose the problem by setting ppc to a medium-low value and allow a
correspondingly large number of chares by setting p to a somewhat higher value.
